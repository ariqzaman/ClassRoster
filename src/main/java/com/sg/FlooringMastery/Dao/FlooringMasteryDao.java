     * If yes, the data will be added to in-memory storage. If no, simply return to the main menu.
     * The system should generate an order number for the user based on the next available order # (so if there are two orders and the max order number is 4,
     * the next order number should be 5).

     * @param CustomerName May not be blank and is limited to characters [a-z][0-9] as well as periods and comma characters. "Acme, Inc." is a valid name.
     * @param State â€“ Entered states must be checked against the tax file. If the state does not exist in the tax file, we cannot sell there. If the tax file is modified to include the state, it should be allowed without changing the application code.
     * @param ProductType Show a list of available products and pricing information to choose from. Again, if a product is added to the file it should show up in the application without a code change.
     * @param Area  The area must be a positive decimal. Minimum order size is 100 sq ft.
     * @return order that was just made
     * @throws FlooringMasteryPersistenceException
