     * The remaining fields are calculated from the user entry and the tax/product information in the files.

     * @param State â€“ Entered states must be checked against the tax file. If the state does not exist in the tax file, we cannot sell there. If the tax file is modified to include the state, it should be allowed without changing the application code.
     * @param ProductType Show a list of available products and pricing information to choose from. Again, if a product is added to the file it should show up in the application without a code change.
     * @param Area  The area must be a positive decimal. Minimum order size is 100 sq ft.
